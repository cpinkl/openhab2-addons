# Hideki Binding

This binding provides native support for Hideki based weather stations, like Cresta, TFA-Dostmann and many others.
Two different wireless receivers are implemented now:
  * Superheterodyne (RXB6, RXB8 and similar)
  * Based on CC101 chip

## Supported Things

Receiver, Thermometer, Anemometer

## Discovery

Discovery is not available.

## Binding Configuration

_If your binding requires or supports general configuration settings, please create a folder ```cfg``` and place the configuration file ```<bindingId>.cfg``` inside it. In this section, you should link to this file and provide some information about the options. The file could e.g. look like:_

```
# Configuration for the Philips Hue Binding
#
# Default secret key for the pairing of the Philips Hue Bridge.
# It has to be between 10-40 (alphanumeric) characters 
# This may be changed by the user for security reasons.
secret=EclipseSmartHome
```

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the information that is available within ```ESH-INF/binding``` of your binding._

_If your binding does not offer any generic configurations, you can remove this section completely._

## Thing Configuration

_Describe what is needed to manually configure a thing, either through the (Paper) UI or via a thing-file. This should be mainly about its mandatory and optional configuration parameters. A short example entry for a thing file can help!_

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Channels

_Here you should provide information about available channel types, what their meaning is and how they can be used._

_Note that it is planned to generate some part of this based on the XML files within ```ESH-INF/thing``` of your binding._

## Full Example

_Feel free to add additional sections for whatever you think should also be mentioned about your binding!_
